## 🏆 Notable Achievement

One of the projects I’m most proud of was stabilising a production mobile application that kept crashing due to memory-heavy background jobs.  
I identified the root cause and redesigned the architecture by isolating background processing onto a dedicated server.  
This eliminated crashes, improved system stability, and kept infrastructure costs minimal.
